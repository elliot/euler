A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Answer: 906609

Place:  188171

Adjustments
    - Changed loops to count down instead of up
    - Only stored the largest palindrome instead of all in the number space
    - Short cut the palindrome check if the product isn't larger than the current largest
    - Avoided double counting (i.e. x = 132, y = 528 || x = 528, y = 132) by using x as the max bound
